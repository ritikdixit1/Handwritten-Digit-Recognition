# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Performed Handwritten digit recognition with the help of MNIST datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) models. The main objective is to compare the accuracy of the models stated above along with their execution time to get the best possible model for
digit recognition.
